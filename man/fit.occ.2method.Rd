\description{
This function fits an occupancy model to simulated detection histories using the package unmarked for species that are detected with two detection methods
A trend in occupancy is estimated and confidence intervals are calculated depending on the Type I error rate. A one-tailed or two-tailed significance test is then conducted on the trend parameter
A one-tailed test looks to see if the upper or lower confidence interval is greater than or less than zero. A two-tailed test assesses whether both the upper and lower confidence
intervals have the same sign (i.e. are both positive or negative). If park.power = TRUE, model fitting is repeated on sites from each regional level management unit.
